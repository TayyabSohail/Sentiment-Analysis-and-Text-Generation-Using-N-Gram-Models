# Sentiment-Analysis-and-Text-Generation-Using-N-Gram-Models

This project implements a sentiment analysis system to classify movie reviews as "positive" or "negative" and generates new reviews using n-gram models (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams). By processing a dataset of movie reviews from IMDB, the project demonstrates how n-gram models can capture language patterns for effective text prediction and sentiment classification.


# Features
Sentiment Classification: Accurately classifies movie reviews based on sentiment.
Text Generation: Generates new reviews using learned n-gram patterns.
Modeling Techniques: Utilizes unigram, bigram, and trigram models to analyze and predict text.


# Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python


# Libraries:
pandas: For data handling and file reading.
NLTK: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization.


# Results
Frequency counts of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams.
Generated sentences demonstrating language patterns.
Sentiment analysis of generated sentences.
Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy for classifier performance.
